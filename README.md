📝Registration Form with Validation

A beginner-friendly registration form built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.It validates user input like empty fields, email format, password length, and password match, and gives instant feedback with a success message.
This is my first JavaScript project, created to explore form validation and improve my frontend development skills 🚀.

Features

✅ Username, email, password & confirm password fields

✅ Real-time validation with helpful error messages

✅ Success alert on valid form submission
